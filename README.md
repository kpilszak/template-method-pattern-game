## General info
This project shows usage of template method pattern.  
The main principle is to let subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.  
In template method pattern we create an abstract class defining operations with a template method set to be final so that it cannot be overridden. Concrete classes extend the abstract class and override its methods.
